# lr_model_house_price
Linear Regression model for house price prediction.

Data is preprocessed with following of steps and procedures like:

checking and removing for null values. Null values are trated in such a wa that is Null values are found in dependet variables then theentire row that is containing the NUll value is deleted because 
imputing the value of dependent variable with aother value will dratcially decrease the performance of the model. in independennt variablesthe Null values are imputed with aonther value such as  mean or median value.

converting values into integer

Identification of Dependent and Independent variables 

exploring of data on with the help of libraray - matplotlib
sych as: using BoxPLot for checking on outliers.
making a custofunction that will remove the outliers

converting the categorical values to numerical values.

using dummy and binnign for converting the categorical variable to the numerical variable as Linear Regression model works on numerical variable.
